                <p>Do you know how ConcurrentHashMap works? If you think that it uses list of Segments in order to
                    provide ReadWriteLock for each element in NodeEntry array then you are welcome to read this post
                    about ConcurrentHashMap internals.</p>

                <h1>Lies about CHM</h1>
                <p>I read a lot of articles and I thought that my knowledge about ConcurrentHashMap(CHM) is right. CHM
                    has an array of Nodes which stores each key,value pairs and CHM has array of segments which is
                    used in order to provide a lock for every element of node array. After that I checked the source
                    code
                    of Java 11 and I was surprised. This is how Segment class looks like.</p>
                <img src="../../images/segment.png" alt="Segment">
                <p>The comment above says <code>Used in previous version</code>. This class is not used in jdk 1.8 and
                    above because the algorithm was rewritten. There are a lot of blog posts in internet which still
                    explain CHM using Segments.
                    <br>
                    For example this <a target="_blank"
                                        href="https://medium.com/@mr.anmolsehgal/concurrenthashmap-internal-working-in-java-b2a1a48c7289">blog</a>
                    from 2018 says
                </p>
                <blockquote
                        cite="https://medium.com/@mr.anmolsehgal/concurrenthashmap-internal-working-in-java-b2a1a48c7289">
                    So any write operation(remove/put/clear etc) will work in 3 steps:
                    <br>
                    1. Wait until it gets the lock on that Segment.
                    <br>
                    2. Do the operation.
                    <br>
                    3. Release the lock after it.
                </blockquote>
                <p>While this <a target="_blank"
                                 href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/concurrent-hash-map-in-java/">blog</a> from
                    2019 says</p>
                <blockquote>
                    HashMap it does not apply the same lock on each method it uses a separate lock for each method,
                    <br>
                    It uses re-entrant lock for this purpose. Similar to HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap has 16 buckets i.e
                    <br>
                    segments, to create ConcurrentHashMap with more than 16 buckets it has different constructors.
                </blockquote>
                <p>Both blogs describe how it used to work in jdk7. That is why we should check the source code and see
                    what is really hidden behind this powerful data structure.</p>
                <h1>Reads</h1>
                <p>I want to start explanation with documentation about reads</p>
                <blockquote>
                    * Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not<br>
                    * block, so may overlap with update operations (including {@code put}<br>
                    * and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most<br>
                    * recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding upon their<br>
                    * onset. (More formally, an update operation for a given key bears a<br>
                    * <em>happens-before</em> relation with any (non-null) retrieval for<br>
                    * that key reporting the updated value.) For aggregate operations
                </blockquote>
                <p>In essence, it says that writes don't block reads(reads are non-blocking) and reads see results of
                    the most recently write using happens-before guarantee(if you don't know what it means than I would
                    recommend you
                    to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgiXKPEILoc&t=1929s">this
                        wonderful</a>
                    presentation about it).
                    <br>
                    How reads could see the most recent write? Using volatile read. However, as you remember all key
                    value pairs are stored in Node array and there is no way to read element of the array atomically.
                    This is how <code>NodeArray</code> is declared in CHM source code<br><code>transient volatile
                        Node&ltK,V&lt[] table;</code>.
                    Volatile array means that you could atomically assign new reference to the array but you can't read
                    each element atomically. However, Java has
                    a special class called <code>Unsafe</code>
                    which provides a JNI interface to make atomic reads from any array. With this in mind let's write a
                    pseudocode for the read method.
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k">public V get(Object key) {</span>
     <span>//atomically reads element of the array with given hash using Unsafe</span>
     <span>if ((node = volatileGetNode(getBucketIndex(hash(key)))) != null) {</span>
        <span>// check first node</span>
        <span>if (isKeyEquals(key, hash, node)) {</span>
        <span>    return node.value;</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// walk through the rest to find target node because if there are multiple keys with the same hashcode then CHM uses LinkedList</span>
        <span>while ((node = node.next) != null) {</span>
        <span>    if (isKeyEquals(key, hash, node))</span>
        <span>        return node.value;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>As you can see get method doesn't use any locks.</p>
                <h1>Writes</h1>
                <p>Now let's take a look at insertion documentation</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Insertion (via put or its variants) of the first node in an
                    <br>
                    * empty bin is performed by just CASing it to the bin. This is
                    <br>
                    * by far the most common case for put operations under most
                    <br>
                    * key/hash distributions. Other update operations (insert,
                    <br>
                    * delete, and replace) require locks. We do not want to waste
                    <br>
                    * the space required to associate a distinct lock object with
                    <br>
                    * each bin, so instead use the first node of a bin list itself as
                    <br>
                    * a lock. Locking support for these locks relies on builtin
                    <br>
                    * "synchronized" monitors.
                </blockquote>
                <p>It shows us the reason why Segments array was removed from jdk1.8+. CHM now uses first node of the
                    NodeEntry array as a lock object in order to save a space that were occupied by array of Segments.
                    <br>
                    Apart from it, documentation says that if node will be inserted into the empty bin
                    (Empty bin means there are no other nodes in the array with the same hashcode) then the node will
                    be inserted in
                    lock free way using Compare-And-Swap(CAS).Let's look at the pseudocode of the put method borrowed
                    from <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/327186/">habr.</a>
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k">public V put(K key, V value) {</span>
 Node&ltK, V> node;
 while (true) {
    // if bucket is empty try to set new head with cas
    if(node = volatileGetNode(bucketIndex)) == null) {
      //if we succeeded to create a new bin then just stop the while loop
        if (compareAndSwapNode(bucketIndex, new Node<>(key,value)))
                    break;
       //otherwise another thread inserted a bin at the same time,
       // in this case the node is already initialized(condition above that checks for null will fail)
       // and we can acquire a lock on it
    } else{
            //get a lock and just insert new one as the last element of LinkedList
            synchronized (node) {
                Node nextNode = node;
                while(next.next != null){
                    nextNode = nextNode.next;
                }
                nextNode.next = new Node(key,value);
            }
        }
 }
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>So when two threads tries to insert nodes with the same hashcodes at empty bin, only one of them will
                    succeed and
                    the second one will acquire a lock on a newly created node in order to insert a second node into the
                    end of
                    the Linkedlist.</p>
                <h1>Lambda methods</h1>
                <p>In addition to get and put , CHM has a lot of methods that accept a lambda as an argument such
                    as <code>computeIfAbsent,computeIfPresent,merge</code>. All those methods are thread safe.
                    I would like to mention method merge which is really elegant and not everyone know about it.
                    I firstly found this method when I tried to solve this problem from <a
                            href="https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/">leetcode</a>.
                    Let's say you have a line of words separated by white spaces. You want to count how many times each
                    word is presented
                    in this line ,that is why you will use a map where key is word and
                    value is an integer that shows how many times this word was repeated in this line. The code below
                    shows
                    you non thread safe version of the solution
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k">void count(String line){</span>
         ConcurrentHashMap&ltString,Integer> counts = new CHM();
                for(String word : line.split(" "){
                     count.putIfAbsent(word,1);
                     count.computeIfPresent(word,(k,v)->v+1);
              }
                        </code>
                        </pre>

                <p>This code is not thread safe because it uses two atomic operations in separate. In order to protect
                    this code from threads intervention , method has to be declared as synchonized.
                    However , there is more elegant way to replace two method calls with one using <code>merge</code>.
                    <br>
                    This is how the same code looks like using merge<code>count.merge(word,1,Integer::sum)</code>. Merge
                    takes 3
                    parameters.
                    First one is key, second one is value and third parameter is lambda which will be used if given key
                    value
                    pair already exists in Map, otherwise method will work as a simple put. In our case, it will simply
                    add 1 to the value if word already exists.

                <h1>Other mysteries</h1>
                <p>Apart from get and put CHM does a great job to :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lazily initialize NodeEntry array</li>
                    <li>Resize NodeEntry array</li>
                    <li>Replace LinkedList with RedBlackTree if amount of nodes with the same hashcode is bigger than
                        threshold
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally there is another ConcurrentMap implementation in standard jdk called ConcurrentSkipList which
                    uses SkipList data structure under the hood. I will cover internals soon in a separate blog
                    post.</p>
