                <p>
                    Most of the time I am working on a highload JVM based
                    backends and for sure I know the keyword
                    <code>volatile</code>. If you google the meaning
                    , then probably you would find something related to
                    caching. I did too, and it didn't satisfy my
                    curiosity ,so I had to go deeper, way deeper. So why not
                    share my findings
                    here so curious readers can get a better view on the
                    concurrent
                    nature of Java.

                <p>Before explaining what volatile does it would be better to
                    understand what problem it solves in the first place.
                    Let's start with a small code sample
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">class Counter{    </span>
<span class="o">     private int cnt</span>
<span class="o">     public void increment(){ </span>
<span class="o">         this.cnt++</span>
<span class="o">     }</span>
<span class="o">     public int get(){</span>
<span class="o">          return this.cnt</span>
<span class="o">     }</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Straight forward counter that allows you to get and increment
                    the number. But what's going on in terms of CPU ? The
                    silicon mafia
                    ships around 4 CPU cache levels between CPU and RAM.
                    First level is located as close to the CPU as possible and
                    usually has the smallest size(around 16 kilobytes).
                    The most frequently used variables are stored there.
                    Each next level has a bigger size but has a higher access
                    time than each previous level.
                    Moreover, nowadays most hardware is shipped with multiple
                    CPU Cores.
                    CPU cores which may or may not share the same CPU caches.
                    Other than that, each CPU has its own registers. CPU
                    Register is a unit of storage that is accessed primarily
                    by instructions that directly refer to it by name(for
                    example R0 or register 0)
                    Now
                    let's return to the example above that performs a simple
                    increment <code>this.cnt++</code>. To read a single
                    variable means to check if it's present in CPU
                    level 1 cache, most probably it isn't there if we just
                    started
                    the program. Next, the second level cache has to be checked
                    and
                    so
                    on. In a Single Core environment the process would end here
                    and
                    Cpu will have to load the variable from RAM. Just for you to
                    understand the latency it takes for CPU to check each
                    individual
                    cache
                    and RAM here is the nice diagram.</p>

                <p>1 ns for level 1 Cache read versus 100 ns for RAM read, looks
                    impressive, isn't it ? . However, for Multi-CPU systems
                    things become more complicated. Before incrementing the
                    counter,
                    CPU has to ask other cores using system bus whether they
                    have a modified version of this counter in their own caches.
                    If
                    one CPU comes back and says , yes I do, then all cores have
                    to be synchronized with this modified counter(some hardware
                    producers actually make it possible to read
                    this value directly from system bus which eliminate the path
                    through main memory). Now CPU can increment the counter.One
                    thing that I misunderstood is that this variable has to be
                    flushed to main memory after each synchronization which
                    isn't correct(will talk about it later). There is a thing
                    called <strong><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESI_protocol">MESI</a></strong>(I
                    know what you think, but it's another Mesi). It's a cache
                    coherence protocol that basically represents the states that
                    a
                    cached variables can have </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modified - M. The cache line present only in the current
                        cache, and it was modified
                    </li>
                    <li>Exclusive - E. The cache line present only in the
                        current cache, and it wasn't modified
                    </li>
                    <li>Shared - S. The cache line may be stored in other Core's
                        caches. But all of them matches the value from Main
                        memory
                    </li>
                    <li>Invalid - I. When Cache line was marked as Modified(M)
                        or Exclusive(E), the copies of this variable in other
                        caches will be marked as invalid
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>MESI makes all caches to be coherent.</p>
                <p>So now let's google a volatile keyword in Java and the
                    first example you will encounter covers volatile boolean
                    variable</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="o">
public class StoppableTask extends Thread {
  private boolean pleaseStop;

  public void run() {
    while (!pleaseStop) {
      // do some stuff...
    }
  }

  public void tellMeToStop() {
    pleaseStop = true;
  }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>We have a Thread(first) that does some job in an infinite
                    loop,
                    and
                    then let's assume that another Thread from completely
                    different Core calls <code>tellMeStop</code> that will
                    change
                    the value of boolean variable which will stop the infinite
                    loop the first thread is running
                    . If you don't declare this variable as volatile ,then the
                    first
                    Thread can cache this boolean variable in CPU cache and
                    reread it from there, the thing that another thread changes
                    the variable won't affect the first thread because the
                    variable
                    will still be read from local cache. That's how most
                    articles explain the <code>volatile</code> keyword, use it
                    or
                    otherwise Thread will cache the variable.
                    But wait, didn't I just told you about this
                    <strong>MESI</strong> thing and that CPU can't modify
                    variable unless all other copies are synchronized ?
                    How is it even possible that Thread can cache a value with a
                    cache coherence protocol? That's why I was confused, and it
                    took me
                    a
                    while to get an answer so here it is. The thing is,it's not
                    even about CPU caches, it's about CPU registers. When
                    you compile and run your Java application , javac and then
                    JIT makes a completely valid assumption that your program
                    will be executed in a single Threaded environment. As a
                    result, the compiler can make a really great optimization.
                    Let's
                    take a look at the class above after compilation
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="o">
public class StoppableTask extends Thread {

  public static void main(String[] argc){
       new StoppableTask().run();
  }
  private boolean pleaseStop = true;

  public void run() {
    while (true) {
      // do some stuff...
    }
  }

  public void tellMeToStop() {
    pleaseStop = true;
  }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Compiler is smart enough to see
                    that main thread doesn't call <code>tellMeStop</code> which
                    means there is no way a boolean variable can be modified.
                    This variable will then be stored in the CPU Register. CPU
                    register is not the same as CPU cache, it's a small storage
                    which is located
                    <strong>Within the CPU</strong>. The access from this
                    storage in much faster than reading from CPU cache.
                </p>
                <p>But what if we are in a multithreading environment? Still,
                    even if an application uses multiple threads, compiler is
                    allowed to make an assumption that those threads won't
                    communicate with each other using Object variables so each
                    Thread is allowed to create a local copy of every
                    Object/primitive they are working with and store them in CPU
                    registers where those threads are running.
                    Remember, all caches are coherent but CPU registers are not.
                    If thread writes something to a variable and it happens that
                    this variable is still inside of a CPU register then there
                    is no way other Threads which are running on different CPUs
                    will see the change.
                    Is there a way to prevent the compiler storing this variable
                    in the Register ? Yes , and it's <code>volatile</code>
                </p>
                <h1>Volatile</h1>
                <p>
                    So now when you know what MESI is, what is a CPU Register
                    and how the program works
                    within
                    multiple Cores , let's talk about volatile.
                    The <code>volatile</code> keyword is nothing more than
                    telling compiler that storing variable in the Register is
                    prohibited. If thread wants to read a variable it has to
                    read it from cache(unless the variable isn't there in which
                    case Main memory would be involved), if Thread wants to
                    modify the variable then it has to write it back to the CPU
                    cache where it was stored and then MESI will synchronize
                    caches from other CPU Cores.
                    Ok, so what If
                    you annotate all variables as volatile in a single threaded
                    program ? As I said , the Thread won't be able to store the
                    variable in the Registers but there is another problem.
                    Volatile in Java has another property which
                    prevents instruction reordering.

                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="o">
public class Reordering  {
  private int foo;
  private int bar;

  public void run() {
        this.foo+=1;
        this.bar+=2;
        this.foo+=2;
  }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Let's look at the code above.For a moment , forget about CPU
                    registers. Two variables are incremented
                    sequentially, in terms of a processor, <code>foo</code> will
                    be loaded into
                    the cache and incremented by one, but let's say the cache is
                    full now(which is not , remember level 1 cache is 16 kb and
                    there are different cache levels, but let's pretend we can
                    only save one int in the cache) and CPU can't load
                    <code>bar</code> into the cache
                    so OS decided to flush <code>foo</code> back to main memory.
                    Then <code>bar</code> was loaded and incremented by two and
                    again, we
                    can't load <code>foo</code> into the cache to increment it
                    by
                    two
                    because <code>bar</code> occupied entire cache size so it
                    has to be flushed. It
                    involves a lot of rounds between RAM and CPU caches.
                    Can we make it better ? Of course , compiler will
                    reorder your instructions to make it faster.
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="o">
public class Reordering  {
  private int foo;
  private int bar;

  public void run() {
        this.foo+=3;
        this.bar+=2;
  }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>So <code>foo</code> will be loaded only once and be
                    incremented by 3
                    in one instruction.Because for single threaded program it
                    doesn't
                    matter whether
                    you increment <code>foo</code> by 3 in one instruction or
                    with two
                    separate ones, the end result is the same. However,
                    for multithreading programs it's not the case. If compiler
                    reorder instructions the second thread can see the
                    following state entering the method <code>{foo = 3, bar =
                        0}</code> which doesn't make any sense if you look at
                    the source code. So the second property of
                    <code>volatile</code> apart from visibility is preventing
                    instruction reordering</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span

public class Reordering  {
  private volatile int foo;
  private int bar;

  public void run() {
        this.foo+=1;//can't be reordered
        this.bar+=2;
        this.foo+=2;
  }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>So to answer the previous question, volatile in single
                    threaded environment will prevent reordering which will make
                    your program slower, so my advice is , do not use it as long
                    as you don't use multithreading</p>
                <h1>Happens Before</h1>
                <p>Apart from volatile there are other ways to make changes from
                    one thread to be visible to others . All these ways are
                    combined into a set rules called Happens-Before
                    guarantee. Let's take a look at some of them</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Synchronized block/method - All writes inside of a
                        synchronized method/block will be visible to another
                        Thread that
                        starts executing this block/method

       this.first++;
       this.second++;

                    <li>All write to volatile variables happens before read from
                        this volatile variable. And this one is handy because it
                        also works for all nonvolatile writes that happened
                        before write to a single volatile variable

                <h1>False Sharing</h1>
                <p>When I described the MESI protocol, I was talking about this
                    thing called a cache line. The thing is , CPU doesn't load
                    data from RAM in terms of variables, it loads data in terms
                    of
                    cache lines. Each cache line represents a contiguous list of
                    memory with predefined size(for example on Intel
                    architecture the cache line is 64 bytes). False sharing is
                    when different variables lie on the same
                    cache line. The False Sharing is a source of performance
                    degradation. So what does it look like ? </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="o">
public class FalseSharing  {
    private volatile long firstCnt = 0;
    private volatile long secondCnt = 0;

    public void methodThatRunOnSecondThread(){
       this.secondCnt++;
    }

    public void methodThatRunOnFirstThread(){
       this.firstCnt++;
    }
}
</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Let's take a look at the code snipped above. We have a class
                    with two long variables, both of them are volatile. The
                    instance of this class will take up to 32 bytes(8*2=16 bytes
                    for two long variables, plus 12 bytes for object
                    metadata plus the alignment to 8 bytes). Now we have two
                    Threads running on different
                    cores each calling a method that increments a single
                    counter. So without cache lines it will work
                    the following way: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First thread cached <code>firstCnt</code> in Level 1
                        cache and started incrementing it
                    </li>
                    <li>Second thread cached <code>secondCnt</code> in Level 1
                        cache of another CPU core and started incrementing it
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, CPU works in terms of cache lines and because the
                    instance of a class takes only 32 bytes, it will fit into a
                    single cache line(which is 64 bytes). So now let's see how
                    both Threads will work with same cache line.
                    First thread updates the first counter, but because second
                    variable is stored on the same cache line MESI has to update
                    cache of the second Core and same will happen when second
                    thread updates the second variable. It's a big
                    problem which
                    literally kills the performance because it involves a lot of
                    IO between different Cores. How do we deal with it ?
                    Of course using annotations
                </p>

                <h2>Meet @Contended</h2>
                <p>In order to solve the problem above we can put one counter
                    into a separate cache line, but counter is a long, and it
                    only takes 8 bytes. To deal with it, we can annotate the
                    property of class as <code>@Contended</code> so the single
                    variable will occupy the whole cache line and with wasted
                    space</p>

                <h1>Finale</h1>
                <p>I hope that now readers can understand what's going on at a
                    hardware level and how some compiler optimization can ruin
                    the correctness of a program execution. JVM is a great
                    platform that encapsulates all kind of complicated things
                    related to hardware, however, in order to understand
                    performance degradation of your app it's obligatory to
                    understand how these things work on bare metal. CPU caches
                    solve the gap between the fast CPU and slow main memory ,
                    and data structures which are nicely aligned in cache lines
                    will always benefit from caching . Or as was said by Scott
                    Meyers "Show me your fancy data structure, and I promise ,
                    simple array will be faster". One thing I want to mention is
                    that JVM specification doesn't talk in terms of CPU caches
                    or registers.
                    It specifies the semantics based on an abstract machine.
                    It's up to the Java Runtime Environment to execute the code
                    on a concrete machine in such a way, that it fulfils the
                    specification
                    There are
                    some resources I found useful related to CPU cache in terms
                    of Hardware and how JVM works with them. Check them out
