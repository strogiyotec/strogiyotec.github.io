                <p>
                    Whether you like it or not, but Hibernate is the most
                    popular
                    ORM solution for JVM based languages.
                    I have used it in all companies I worked for(starting from
                    big
                    E-commerce sites and ending with small startups).
                    Honestly I don't like having Hibernate or any JPA
                    implementations
                    in projects I am working on
                    because in my humble opinion it brings a huge
                    layer of complexity(read on to know a reason). There are
                    some alternatives such as <a
                    href="https://www.jooq.org/">JOOQ</a> and <a
                    href="https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/">MyBatis</a>(personally
                    my favorite one). Also I heard about <a
                    href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc">Spring
                    Data JDBC</a> but
                    didn't have a chance to use it. So why do I think that
                    Hibernate is a bad thing, well , one part of a reason is a
                    documentation
                    but the biggest problem is developers
                </p>

                </figure>
                <h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>
                <p>The documentation of Hibernate is really obscure. It doesn't
                    cover a great variety of cases and the only way to find out
                    why you have an unexpected behaviour is to refer to <a
                        href="https://vladmihalcea.com/blog/">Vlad Mihalcea blog
                        posts</a>(or StackOverFlow).</p>
                <p>
                    As an example, in one of the companies I worked for we had a
                    problem
                    when EntityGraph didn't work for nested collections.
                    There is no documentation that covers a reason and searching
                    through the github issues gave us a ticket
                    with exactly the same problem that has been solved in a
                    newest
                    Hibernate release, because project was using Spring Boot, we
                    had to wait
                    for Spring Boot team to release a new major version that
                    bumps
                    Hibernate version in a parent bom. <br>
                    But these kind of problems are somewhat resolvable, you
                    google ,
                    debug Hibernate's source code(trust me, not a pleasant
                    experience) or see release notes to see if your problem has
                    been solved, so documentation is not a biggest pitfall.
                </p>
                <h1>Developers</h1>
                <p>One thing I noticed everytime I start working on a new
                    project. Java developers don't know how to organize an
                    entity layer. As an example, let's say we are building an
                    e-commerce website, of course we have a
                    user,orders,items,comment tables.
                    Order has a foreign key to user and item , and so does a
                    comment table.
                    We can go to Hibernate's quick start page and see how to map
                    these relationships
                    to Entity class.</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Entity("user)</span>
<span class="o">class UserEntity{    </span>
<span class="o">    @OneToMany(init=LAZY)</span>
<span class="o">    private List&lt;Orders&gt; orders</span>
<span class="o">    @OneToMany(init=LAZY)</span>
<span class="o">    private List&lt;Comments&gt; comments</span>
<span class="o">    //credentials</span>
<span class="o">    private String username</span>
<span class="o">    private String password</span>
<span class="o">    private Role role</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Straight forward right? Yes it is , but the problem here is
                    what are responsibilities of this class<br> (<span>I</span>
                    in SOLID).To put it another way, in which case Am I allowed
                    to change this
                    class ?</p>
                <h2 id="problem1">Problem 1 - Smart Entities</h2>
                <p>Let's say we are using Spring Security to add a security
                    layer for http based endpoints.Spring requires you to
                    provide an implementation of <a
                        href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.9.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/UserDetails.html">UserDetails
                    </a>
                    interface that has methods to get user's name,password and
                    roles. A User Entity class already has these parameters
                    right? So why not just use it ?<code>class UserEntity
                        implements
                        UserDetails</code>. If you do so then the whole
                    security layer will be mixed up with business logic. You
                    will be able to access user's orders right from
                    ServletListener.Whenever
                    you change User Entity apart from checking a business logic
                    you will have to check that it won't break a security layer
                    too . Does it follow a single responsibility
                    principle ? I doubt it does. So what is a solution ?</p>
                <p>Hibernate doesn't mention it explicitly but you don't have to
                    have a single Entity that represents a database table. What
                    if we keep a User Entity above and introduce a new one </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Entity("user)//same user table</span>
<span class="o">class UserCredentialsEntity implements UserDetails{    </span>
<span class="o">    //credentials</span>
<span class="o">    private String username</span>
<span class="o">    private String password</span>
<span class="o">    private Role role</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>So now whenever Hibernate fires a select query it won't touch
                    any dependencies apart from the fields listed in
                    UserCredentials class </p>
                <h2 id="problem2">Problem 2 - DTO layer</h2>
                <p>I think everybody knows what the fetch modes in Hibernate
                    are.
                    In essence it's a way to let Hibernate know when you need to
                    use joins to fetch class dependencies or just fetch
                    attributes of a single table. I bet you saw <code>LazyInitException</code>
                    before which happens
                    when you try to access a nested object or collection out of
                    a transaction which
                    was loaded lazily. Let's have another
                    use case with the same User Entity.
                    Imagine when users open their profiles, they only see their
                    names and some meta information such as birth , city and so
                    on. Spring
                    has a pattern called DTO which implies that you can't expose
                    an Entity layer into a controller layer or put it another
                    way,
                    the controller has to return a DTO, not a business Entity.
                    Imagine you have a layer that transforms an entity into a
                    dto(if you don't want to write this layer manually then
                    check out a <a href="https://mapstruct.org/">MapStruct</a>
                    project that does it for you)
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Service</span>
<span class="o">class EntityToDto {    </span>
<span class="o">    public UserDto userToDTO(UserEntity user){</span>
<span class="o">       ...</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>And here is the UserDTO</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">class UserDTO</span>
<span class="o">    private String name</span>
<span class="o">    private String birthday</span>
<span class="o">    private List&lt;CommentsDto&gt; comments</span>
<span class="o">    private List&lt;OrdersDto&gt; orders</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>So how <code>EntityToDto</code> is supposed to know whether
                    <code>UserEntity</code> was loaded with or without
                    corresponding orders? One solution I see often is to inject
                    an <code>EntityManager</code> right
                    into<code>EntityToDto</code> and check every single
                    dependency
                    (If you don't care about exposing a JPA implementation , you
                    can use static method from Hibernate
                    <code>Hibernate.isInitialized(entity);</code> but new
                    problem arises, it's hard to test a class that uses static
                    methods).</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Service</span>
<span class="o">class EntityToDto</span>
<span class="o">    @Autowired EntityManager entityManager</span>
<span class="o">    public UserDto userToDto(UserEntity user){</span>
<span class="o">        if(entityManager.getEntityManagerFactory().getPersistenceUnitUtil().isLoaded(user.getOrders())){</span>
<span
    class="o">           userDto.setOrders(this.ordersToDto(user.getOrders));</span>
</code></pre>

                <p>It's just horrible, now Dto layer has an EntityManager, a
                    manager that can easily fire sql queries right from
                    DtoLayer.
                    What is more , Dto layer is becoming too smart, it can work
                    with a case when the user has or doesn't have loaded
                    orders(Interface segregation principle).
                    What is a solution? The one I came up with is to introduce a
                    third UserEntity class that doesn't have a dependency on
                    orders and credentials.
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Entity("user)//same user table</span>
<span class="o">class UserProfileEntity {    </span>
<span class="o">    private String name</span>
<span class="o">    private String birthday</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>It doesn't have any information about credentials because
                    they are only known by the security layer and it doesn't
                    have
                    orders. So now UserProfileEntity is only responsible for
                    a user page and we can remove entity manager from Dto
                    .Moreover, now we can modify
                    <code>UserEntity</code> class by declaring all dependencies
                    as eager.We know for sure that users of this class will work
                    with orders, so there is no need to declare orders as lazy.
                </p>
                <blockquote>I see your point, but we would end up having too
                    many classes, is it any better than having a single class
                    per table?
                </blockquote>
                <p>Ok, let me convince you with one more example, the problem is
                    not only
                    in DtoLayer but in the repository layer too. Repository
                    layer <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design">encapsulates
                        the logic required to access data sources</a>. Having
                    single user entity means we need multiple methods to fetch
                    the same user with/without orders
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">interface UserRepo extends CrudRepository</span>
<span class="o">    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"orders"})</span>
<span
    class="o">    List&lt;UserEntity&gt; getUserWithOrders(String userId);    </span>
<span class="o"></span>
<span class="o">    List&lt;UserEntity&gt; getUser(String userId);    </span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>In the example above we are using Spring Data to generate two
                    methods, using EntityGraph we are telling Hibernate when to
                    load a lazy collection. I think the repository layer
                    shouldn't
                    be mixed up with this logic, it should only be
                    responsible for fetching data without knowing how to do
                    it. Introducing a new entity class that doesn't contain
                    any refereces to other tables precisely solves this
                    problem. </p>
                <h2 id="problem3">Problem 3 - Spring Data is bloated</h2>
                <p>I assume nowadays most people are working with Hibernate
                    through Spring Data abstraction, it's great and allows you
                    to get rid of a boilerplate, however, I advise you not to
                    leak
                    Spring Data Repositories into a Service layer.</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;UserEntity,Long&gt;{</span>
<span class="o">        UserEntity getOneById(Long id);</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Here is one example of Spring Repository,
                    implementation will be created in runtime by spring and
                    using specific naming convention it understands what kind of
                    query you are expecting(in example above it's a select of a
                    single user by id). But because you extend <code>CrudRepository</code>
                    your interface gets additional methods such as fetching and
                    deleting
                    all users. According to Martin Fowler
                    ,Service layer defines <a
                        href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">a
                        set of available operations and
                        coordinates the application's response in each
                        operation</a>. Having the repository above in <code>UserService</code>
                    we imply that deleting all users from the database is a part
                    of
                    a service operation but it's not. There is a great
                    <a href="https://www.vzurauskas.com/2019/04/07/two-layer-repositories-in-spring">article</a>
                    that proposes an idea of having Spring layers encapsulated
                    by Domain Objects . But this approach is hard to implement
                    in
                    existing applications. What I propose is something similar,
                    create a sub package where you store Spring data
                    repositories(ideally make it package friendly so only
                    classes from the same package can have an access ) and then
                    introduce
                    a new repository package that contains your domain specific
                    datasource interaction.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>In the example above we have a repository class which only
                    has 1
                    method, then instead of injecting Spring Data Repo ,the
                    service
                    layer will use this Repository. Cons ? A new
                    repository clearly defines a datasource operation that can
                    be used by the service layer.</p>

                    tricky</h2>
                <p>I noticed that many people don't really understand how
                    transaction management works.Having
                    <code>@Transactional</code> on top of your method will make
                    a deal right? Let's make a small test, do you see a problem
                    in the code below ? We are trying to update a user with data
                    from html form.
                </p>

</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>If you don't then read on. All entities managed by Hibernate
                    have a state, if your entity is inside of a database
                    transaction it has a managed state, as soon as transactional
                    method is about to exit, hibernate checks if any fields were
                    modified , if they were, then Hibernate fires an update
                    query , put it another way , you don't have to call <code>save</code>
                    , calling a setter is enough.That is why, even though
                    birthday was invalid and method save wasn't called, the
                    user's name
                    will be updated anyway, if it's a part of a business
                    requirements then that's totally fine, otherwise good luck
                    debugging the cause .Some other things to
                    consider, If you have a transactional method ,same as above,
                    how to reuse it using a different propagation level(let's
                    say execute a method in a new transaction even though
                    method was called from another transactional). I know some
                    workarounds but don't want to describe them , cause it's
                    not the best choice. Let me know if you are familiar with a
                    stable solution</p>
                <h2 id="problem5">Problem 5 - How Delete Works</h2>
                <p>Let's take a look at UserEntity for the last time.What if we
                    want to delete a user by id who has a list of orders, let's
                    say 5 orders. How many sql queries will be executed ? The
                    answer is 6, 5 to delete every individual order , and then
                    one to
                    delete a user. Couldn't Hibernate just run 2 queries instead
                    ?
                    <code>DELETE order where user_id=?; DELETE user where
                        id=?; </code>. Unfortunately it can't because one of the
                    orders can be a part of a different transaction and as a
                    result stored in Hibernate context. If deleting users isn't
                    a common operation then leaving it as it is would be the
                    best choice. However, if it's a critical part of an
                    application then we have to rewrite it. One solution is to
                    introduce a native query in the Repository layer.</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">interface UserRepository{</span>
<span class="o">    @Modifying</span>
<span class="o">    @Query(nativeQuery = true,value = "DELETE from order where user_id = :userId")</span>
<span
    class="o">        void deleteOrdersByUser(@Param("userId") Long uidpk);</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>The problem here is that native queries are not tracked by
                    Hibernate listeners(<code>@EntityListener</code>) which
                    means if you have some hooks that
                    have to be executed right after you delete an order(let's
                    say
                    save some statistics and then send an email to
                    managers) then they won't work.One solution I come up with
                    is to use Spring's integrated event bus library </p>

                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k">@Component</span>
<span class="o">class EntityListener</span>
<span class="o">   @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)</span>
<span class="o">   @PreRemove</span>
<span class="o">      public void preRemove(final Order order) {...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o"></span>
<span class="o">@Component</span>
<span class="o">public class ApplicationDeleteListener implements ApplicationListener&lt;OrderDeleteEvent&gt; {</span>
<span class="o">   @Autowired EntityListener listener</span>
<span class="o">   public void onApplicationEvent(final OrderDeleteEvent entityDeleteEvent) {</span>
<span
    class="o">       this.listener.preRemove(entityDeleteEvent.getOrder());</span>
<span class="o">    }</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>In this case when order was deleted by Hibernate, the
                    @EntityListener will be called automatically, otherwise you
                    have to publish an event into the EventBus which will
                    delegate a hook logic to EntityListener.</p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>There is no way JVM based backends(most of them) will get rid
                    of the Hibernate in the near future,so the only thing we can
                    do as developers is to
                    introduce a good level of abstraction and don't forget
                    that SOLID principles could be applied to entity layer
                    too.</p>
