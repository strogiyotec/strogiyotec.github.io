                <p>
                    I have been using Ubuntu
                    since 2018 , but I have
                    never heard about VIM
                    till the summer of 2019.
                    I clearly remember this
                    day when I had a pair
                    programming session with
                    my Team Lead where we
                    tried to solve some
                    config bug in production
                    server.The server didn't
                    have nano(console based
                    text editor that I used
                    before).So consequently
                    I asked how am I
                    supposed to edit this
                    file through ssh session
                    in terminal.And at this
                    point of time I met an
                    awful editor called Vim
                    which took me 50 minutes
                    to change one line of
                    code(Team Lead didn't
                    help and asked to figure
                    this out by my own) and
                    I never regret about it
                    because it completely
                    changed the way I use my
                    environment in a daily
                    basics.

                    <img
                            src="../../images/exit_vim.png"
                            alt="Vim"
                    />
                </figure>
                <h1>Best text editor</h1>
                <p>
                    Since then , I have been
                    learning Vim and still I
                    could find a thousand of
                    features that I'm not
                    aware of.<br/>
                    But if it is as awful as
                    I said before then why
                    did I decide to use it
                    in the first place? To
                    be honest I didn't. I
                    hated this editor
                    because I thought about
                    it as a cumbersome
                    software which is hard
                    to use and it doesn't
                    worst it. Just for
                    curiosity , I googled
                    how people usually use
                    it and I was shocked. I
                    didn't see black screen
                    that I saw in the first
                    time. I saw
                    autosuggestion and
                    syntax highlighting
                    inside the editor with a
                    beautiful theme. And
                    then I started my
                    journey with Vim(Right
                    now I use
                    <a
                            href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim"
                    >Neovim</a
                    >).So why Vim and how it
                    changed the way I think
                    and use the software.
                </p>
                <h1>VIM?</h1>
                According to Wikipedia
                <blockquote>
                    Vim is the editor of
                    choice for many
                    developers and power
                    users. It’s a “modal”
                    text editor based on the
                    vi editor written by
                    Bill Joy in the 1970s
                    for a version of UNIX.
                    It inherits the key
                    bindings of vi, but also
                    adds a great deal of
                    functionality and
                    extensibility that are
                    missing from the
                    original vi.

                <p>
                    Vim is super
                    configurable. You could
                    customize every keyboard
                    or combination of
                    keyboards to do whatever
                    you want.The best advise
                    that I want to share:
                    Don't copy paste a whole
                    config from other
                    people.Don't do it.
                    Every person who knows
                    how to use Vim configure
                    it for own purposes.
                    Learn how to configure
                    Vim and then check how
                    other people do it in
                    order to take some
                    ideas. But never blindly
                    copy paste it(I did once
                    and it took me a lot
                    time to understand why
                    all keys that I knew
                    didn't work as I
                    expected).BTW here is
                    mine

                    if you need some
                    inspiration. It's
                    configured to work with
                    js,python and golang.

                    I don't know much about
                    VSCode but IntellijIdea
                    doesn't have the variety
                    of plugins that Vim
                    has.All of them are
                    opensourced and managed

                    What is wrong with GUI
                    editors?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    My favorite editor is
                    Intellij.It really
                    increases my
                    productivity working
                    with huge Java
                    codebases.However it has
                    two huge disadvantages.
                    First of all, the
                    version that I use is
                    not free and Community
                    version doesn't include
                    all the plugins that I
                    need.
                    <br/>
                    Secondly, it's bloated.
                    It consumes a lot of RAM
                    and CPU in my machine which is not the
                    most powerful one(BTW if
                    you use Language server
                    as Coc then it will
                    consume CPU as well
                    because it uses Nodejs
                    under the hood, I had
                    this problem , upgrading
                    Node from 12 to 14 fixed
                    it). <br>
                    Thirdly, it has a bloated ui
                    with thousands of
                    buttons that I don't
                    use and can't
                    remove.Lastly it
                    consumes a battery too
                    fast so it's not a good
                    idea to work with it out
                    of your home.In Vim you
                    configure everything by
                    yourself and if you are
                    not happy about
                    performance or view then
                    it's easy to fix it
                    within your
                    configuration.

                    How vim changed the way
                    I think about a software
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Watching and reading
                    tutorials about vim I
                    always heard the same
                    idea: GUI makes you
                    slow.And it's partly
                    true. It is much faster
                    to open terminal(I use
                    <a
                            href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty"

                    >
                    BTW) and type what you
                    want instead of waiting
                    for GUI window to
                    appear(Yes my laptop is
                    really slow) and
                    then pressing bunch of
                    buttons to finally get
                    an option that you
                    want.The point is:
                    Terminal with keyboard
                    is faster then GUI with
                    mouse.But it's not
                    always possible to
                    replace GUI program with
                    something which is as
                    keyboard driven as Vim
                    or is it?

                    Vim and Vim inspired
                    software made my
                    workflow much easier and
                    faster.I didn't mention
                    all Vim based programs
                    that I use ,probably I
                    will do another post
                    about it where I will
                    explain how awful some
                    programs are(Yes Adobe
                    I'm talking about you)
                    and how to replace them
                    with lightweight, vim
                    based ,open source

                    looks like using my

                    elegant).
