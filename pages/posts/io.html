                <p>In this post I will talk about kernel, io and all these stuff
                    but let's start with a simple question. Nodejs is faster than
                    Java? I've heard it a lot from my
                    friends and from forums on the Internet. Let's make it
                    clear,
                    I am a big fan of Java ,specifically Java Runtime.However, I
                    don't
                    like Annotation driven development though.Let me explain
                    what it means for Java to be slower.A
                    little spoiler, it's all about IO.</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h1>Why is it slower?</h1>
                <p>Let's understand why Java is slower than NodeJs. First of
                    all what do we mean by saying that one language is slower
                    than another. Usually people talk about how fast a language
                    could perform a CPU intensive task. Something like matrix
                    multiplication or finding n-th number in Fibonacci
                    sequence. In this case Java beats Nodejs and even c++
                    (sometimes).Why ? Because of JIT. Java is a compiled
                    language,
                    it is compiled into a specific language called bytecode. JVM
                    interprets this bytecode instruction by instruction which
                    is of course slower than executing compiled machine code.
                    However, JVM has
                    two JIT compilers that periodically compile hot methods into
                    machine specific code. The second JIT is called C2 and it's
                    able to store statistics about each method(thanks to
                    Reflection) that allows it to
                    imply
                    a lot of optimizations into a compiled code. I don't want to
                    go
                    deep in this topic because I am mainly focusing in non CPU
                    related tasks , but if you are interested in JVM internals
                    then you have to watch <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH4_unx8eJQ&t=1147s">this</a>
                    excellent video by Douglas Hawkins</p>
                <p>Okay, now we know that Java beats Nodejs in terms of CPU
                    intensive tasks, then why are there so many articles
                    about big companies moving to Node? I am not the first one
                    to tell you about it, but Nodejs is faster because it
                    doesn't require a lot of user level threads(the ones that
                    you create by using <code>new Thread(runnable)</code>) in
                    order to provide a high performance backend server. You
                    probably heard
                    that Node js is a single threaded and it uses the technique
                    called Event Loop in order to handle all incoming requests.
                    If you are a Java developer then you probably think "What
                    the
                    hell, one thread?".
                    Yes, this question bothered me for a long time .As I said
                    before , I am a Java developer.I got used to thinking about
                    concurrency in terms of Thread Pools. And when someone tells
                    me
                    that
                    a backend server could have only one thread and still
                    perform
                    better than thread pools I just laughed at them. But really,
                    one thread ?
                    How one thread can handle all the traffic. Let's go deeper
                    and understand what an Event Loop is.
                </p>
                <h1>Event Loop</h1>
                <p>Let's look at this picture that I sincerely borrowed from
                    Internet</p>
                <img
                    src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fBEbMgk6--QtIUUed3KcMQ.png"
                    alt="Event loop">
                <p>We have incoming requests and one thread that handles them,
                    if a
                    task is heavy(takes a lot of time) then we assign it to some
                    sort of thread pool
                    and create a callback ,otherwise , the event loop will be
                    blocked, and we won't be able to handle new connections. When
                    the task is finished , the thread pool
                    puts a result of this task back to the event loop , then the
                    event
                    loop will eventually execute a callback on this result
                    . If you need a further explanation then <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ">Philip
                        Roberts</a> will explain it much better than I can.</p>
                <p>Now the tricky question, Ok event loop, but can't we use it
                    in Java ? We can indeed ,moreover Servlet containers such as
                    Tomcat use Event Loop by default. What? Yes, the default
                    connector for Tomcat is based on Java nio which has its own
                    event loop under the hood. Ok , if even Tomcat can do it
                    then what is the purpose of Node? Let's now switch to
                    Tomcat(I chose Tomcat but other servlet containers have the
                    same principles)</p>
                <h1>Tomcat</h1>
                <p>How Tomcat NIO Connector works. First of all we can specify
                    the amount of event loop threads that will handle incoming
                    requests
                    (According to my experience, one thread will be enough).
                    After that, when connection with the client has been
                    established, the event loop puts a task into a queue which is
                    monitored by a thread
                    pool of worker threads.Thread pool takes a task from the
                    queue and assigns a worker
                    thread to it. All application logic (Methods inside your
                    Controllers in Spring) is executed using these
                    threads. The
                    problem here is that application logic usually needs
                    to do some IO tasks such as calling cache service,
                    sending requests to database, making Http calls to other
                    services
                    and so on. In most cases, these requests will block
                    worker thread. When a worker thread is waiting for the
                    Database to
                    respond it doesn't do anything , as a result, if all worker
                    threads are waiting on IO, then Tomcat can't process new
                    tasks from the event loop. The only solution for Servlet
                    containers prior to Servlet 3.1 specification was to
                    increase amount of worker threads, but again , most of them
                    won't do anything but block on IO (BTW I want
                    to write another small blog about
                    Async servlets, because I have seen how developers ,
                    including me, blindly
                    move all application logic from worker threads to async
                    servlets without noticing that it doesn't solve problem of
                    blocking).
                </p>
                <p>Ok, finally the question that I asked myself so many times,
                    how in the hell nodejs uses threads without blocking them,
                    and I want to brag myself, I found the answer.</p>
                <h1>Kernel is the only source of truth</h1>
                <p>You see, NodeJs and Java are just languages, they don't
                    know how to write data to disk , or how to read it.They
                    don't even know how to
                    create new threads. They don't, but Kernel does. What is
                    Kernel ? First of all, I will explain how it works in Linux
                    because I have no clue what Mac and Windows do(honestly, I
                    am just not interested). Kernel is a heart of Linux. It's a
                    layer between user processes and hardware. User processes
                    are not allowed to work with Hardware. Then how can we
                    read/write from a file? Fairly simple, Kernel provides a
                    public API called <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system
                        calls</a>. User processes use
                    these "system calls" and Kernel will do what it is supposed
                    to do. When we write a program(unless writing your own OS)
                    using any programming
                    language, we create a user process ,consequently, our
                    program will use system
                    calls as well. How to check it? Let's write a small Java
                    program
                    that reads a file called input.txt.This file contains only
                    two words <code>Hello world</code></p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
try (FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("input.txt")) {
   int content;
   while ((content = stream.read()) != -1) {
        // just read file byte by byte
      }
   }
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                </figure>
                <p>In order to see all system calls that program uses we can use
                    a cli utility called <a
                        href="https://github.com/strace/strace">strace</a>(most
                    Linux distros include this utility by default so you don't
                    have to install it). If I compile the program above into a
                    native executable using graal and then run this command
                    <code>strace ./main 2> my_log_file</code> I will see the
                    following output in log file.
                </p>

                <p>Now we know that Java calls a system method called
                    read,however read takes a file descriptor(in my case it was
                    number 3) created by <code>openat</code>
                    , let's check the
                    manual for this system call <code>man openat</code>.
                    You will notice that openat creates a blocking file
                    descriptor by default.It means that user thread that uses
                    file descriptor created by openat will have to wait for
                    a response
                    from the kernel, in other words, thread will be blocked. That's
                    it. Here is the answer, all
                    Java
                    classes that inherit Input/Output streams
                    use blocking system calls.
                </p>
                <h1>File Descriptors</h1>
                <p>Remember when I told you about event loop handling incoming
                    requests ?
                    What it really does is, event loop thread makes a system
                    call in order to create a file descriptor for incoming
                    socket connections. In Unix systems everything is file,
                    including sockets.
                    OS creates a unique number called file descriptor and uses
                    it as a file identifier(system calls such as read and write
                    take file descriptor in order to understand from what file
                    to read or write to). Technically , there is no limit on
                    amount of file descriptors, you can open as much as 10K file
                    descriptors in parallel , the only obstacle is RAM,
                    because each file descriptor is an internal structure that
                    occupies some memory (Now you can understand how
                    nginx is able to handle 10K parallel requests, it uses a file
                    descriptors).
                </p>
                <h1>Epoll</h1>
                <p>The way Tomcat's Nio Connector works is approximately the
                    same as how NodeJs works. Then why Node is faster.The tricky
                    part is , NodeJs doesn't use blocking calls. Of course, you
                    can do it , but it's considered as antipattern. Worker
                    threads of Nodejs don't have to wait for IO and therefore
                    use CPU more efficiently than blocked threads from servlet
                    container.In order to
                    implement an event loop ,nodejs uses a C++ library
                    called
                    libuv, this library is a cross platform, but in Linux it
                    uses
                    a system call known as <code>epoll</code>.
                    Again , you can check a manual page related to epoll but
                    here I will give you a brief explanation on how it works.
                    <br>
                    Epoll is a system call that allows us to monitor sockets
                    for new data. When we use epoll, our program doesn't have to
                    wait until new data will appear.As soon as data from sockets
                    is ready, Kernel will give as a list of file descriptors
                    associated with these sockets. Here is a
                    brief example on C
                </p>
                <pre><code>
  //create epoll
  int epoll_fd = epoll_create1(0);
  //event loop
  while(running)
  {
    printf("\nPolling for input...\n");
    //ask kernel which file descriptors have a new data, this call is non blocking
    event_count = epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, MAX_EVENTS, 30000);
    printf("%d ready events\n", event_count);
    for(i = 0; i < event_count; i++)
    {
           //work with available data
			...
    }
  }
                </code></pre>
                <p> Our event loop asks
                    kernel if any sockets have a new data, if so then
                    we can get these data using file descriptor , if no sockets have new data, then
                    kernel returns 0 and
                    main thread doesn't have to wait
                    .Also we have a <code>for</code> loop that works with data,
                    in this
                    loop we can assign heavy tasks to some sort of thread pool
                    because we don't want to block the main thread. When a task
                    is
                    completed we can send a response to a socket using a file
                    descriptor(remember, it's just an id). Under the
                    hood , all event loop
                    based servers use
                    these system calls in order to provide non blocking
                    behavior.</p>
                <h1>Java NIO and Netty</h1>
                <p>Starting from Java 5, we have a new package named NIO. Java
                    Nio gives us an API to use non blocking system
                    calls . So, we have a NIO package, could
                    we improve the servlet problem described above where most
                    worker threads are waiting on blocking system calls ? The
                    answer is, it depends. Java is an old language and as I said
                    before,
                    if you use <code>InputStream</code> class , then your
                    threads
                    will be blocked and I assure you ,you do, the majority of
                    Java
                    libraries use this old class from Java 1. Moreover, JDBC API
                    uses
                    blocking sockets, so all interactions with databases from
                    Java will be blocking. There are some projects aimed at
                    rewriting JDBC in order to use non blocking sockets.
                    The one that I contribute to and most interested in is
                    <a href="https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi">r2dbc</a>. With
                    this library we can send non blocking requests to Database and get a
                    response in the form of Reactive interfaces(Mono or Flux).
                    <br>
                    However, I want to mention that Java ecosystem is huge , and
                    there are a lot of frameworks that don't implement servlet
                    specification. My favorite one is <a
                        href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>. It resembles a
                    Nodejs cause its based on exactly the same algorithms but
                    it uses
                    Java Runtime(in reality , you can use Vert.x with
                    JavaScript, if you are interested check the docs). It's
                    creator ,Tim Fox wanted to bring a
                    powerful , Reactive framework to Java world and I assure you
                    he did indeed.
                </p>
                <h1>Some words about project Reactor</h1>
                <p>One of the newest trends in Java backend development is a
                    project called Reactive Spring and Project Reactor.
                    Now, as you know the main disadvantage of servlets and
                    blocking streams, it's easy to understand what this project
                    tries to solve. It provides a functional API to write a non
                    blocking backend
                    (of course there are more things
                    such as back pressure, but the core idea is that
                    code must be non blocking).
                </p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>I hope that my explanation was clear enough. I spend an
                    enormous
                    amount of time in order to understand how it really works
                    and I want to thank <a
