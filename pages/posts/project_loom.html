            </header>
            <article class="post-content">
                <p>
                    I want to start this year with a blog post about <a
                    href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8277131">Project
                    Loom</a> , a new JEP from Oracle that will bring virtual
                    threads(or coroutines) to the JVM. That's huge and people
                    have been waiting for it for ages. Right now, Java ecosystem
                    provides few frameworks to work with sockets in non-blocking
                    way such as <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project
                    Reactor</a>. I have nothing against of Reactor project,
                    Confluence made a good developer experience for regular devs
                    to use non-blocking API, there is however a big drawback in
                    Reactor that I see. Once you start writing a backend in a
                    reactive style, you can't stop. All blocking calls have to
                    be rewritten using non-blocking API which is a completely
                    new coding style with its own hidden surprises. Of course,
                    all blocking calls can be delegated to dedicated Thread Poll
                    but in this case we are going back to standard thread per
                    request model . But
                    this blog post is not about Reactor, it's about Loom. I
                    spend quite a lot of time trying to understand what Oracle
                    means by saying "Virtual Threads" and how it can solve the
                    problems
                    we face using Servlet API(Spring MVC). And after endless
                    time of
                    reading mailing lists and trying Loom in my local machine I
                    think I finally got it. Before I start, all opinions here
                    are my own and can(probably are) be wrong, always double
                    check by your own and if you see any mistakes please let me
                    know so this blog can become better. And so
                    Let's start
                </p>

                <h1 id="problem">The current state of blocking IO</h1>
                <p>Let's talk about a regular Java backend. You want to write
                    some service that solves a particular business problem. You
                    generate a new Spring boot project that uses Tomcat under
                    the hood, then you create a database schema and use
                    Hibernate as an ORM solution but instead of working with
                    EntityManager directly you delegate the heavy work to Spring
                    Data, and lastly there are probably some other networking
                    services involved so your backend is making http requests
                    to generate email, make a payment and so on. That's a
                    typical Java based backend, and
                    we
                    all are familiar with how it works. </p>
                <p>
                    Under the hood Tomcat uses non-blocking event loop based
                    thread that accepts new connections from users, then it
                    delegates them into a fixed size thread poll that executes a
                    business logic. Business logic almost always contains an IO
                    interaction with remote services such as
                    cache(Redis,Memcached),database(Postgres),
                    third party services(Stripe). Most of the time ,the
                    networking communication
                    logic is written in the blocking way whether it's <code>RestTemplate</code>
                    to send an http request to the service
                    or <code>JdbcTemplate</code> to fetch some data from
                    database. Blocking calls will block a
                    thread from Tomcat's thread poll and the only way to
                    increase the throughput of the backend is to increase the
                    amount of threads in the poll.
                    Increasing amount of threads means more context
                    switching(which is actually fast enough in latests Linux
                    kernels which use
                    a fair scheduler) and more memory used because each
                    thread needs a memory for a stacktrace(this value varies but
                    for my Ubuntu 20.04 it's 8Mb per thread you can check stack
                    trace size by running <code>ulimit -s</code> in your shell).
                    As you can see,
                    increasing amount of threads isn't scalable, so to solve a
                    throughput problem we can use asynchronous style to work
                    with sockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The blocking IO in java is represented by two main classes
                    namely <code>InputStream</code> and
                    <code>OutputStream</code> and their subclasses. Let's say we
                    want to read some data from database using Jdbc, the
                    stacktrace of the program will end up by calling
                    <code>read</code> method of <code>InputStream</code>, here
                    is the interface for this method.
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">abstract class InputStream implements Closeable { </span>
<span class="o">     //Reads the next byte of data from the input stream</span>
<span class="o">     public abstract int read() throws IOException;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Remember, <code>read</code> doesn't specify how it should be
                    implemented , it just tells you that it will return data
                    from the stream. It didn't satisfy my curiosity so I used
                    <code>strace</code>(cli application that keeps track of the
                    system calls your program is making) to see what my Linux
                    machine is actually
                    doing when <code>read</code> is called. So let's say we have
                    a simple program that reads file's content </p>

                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">public class TestInputStream{</span>
<span class="o">    public static void main(final String[] args) {</span>
<span
    class="o">        var body = Files.readAllBytes(Path.of("test.txt"));</span>
<span class="o">         </span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p><code>readAllBytes</code> uses
                    <code>InputStream#read()</code> under the hood. Next step is
                    to compile this java file by using <code>javac
                        Main.java</code>, lastly run this command in your
                    shell<br>
                    <code>strace -o output.txt -f ./bin/java Main</code>.
                    <br>
                    All system calls that Main.java uses were saved into <code>output.txt</code>
                    file. If you open the file, output will be huge because
                    strace also tracked all syscalls that JVM uses upon
                    starting, but I want you to focus on those few lines
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">43338 openat(AT_FDCWD, "test.txt", O_RDONLY) = 4
</span>
<span class="o">43338 read(4, "\0\0\0\30ftypmp42\0\0\0\0isommp42\0\22\321\354moov"..., 75391864) = 75391864
</span>
<span class="o">43338 close(4) = 0</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Let's go over the syscalls line by line</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First we call <code>openat</code> to open the file , the
                        method returns a file descriptor(number 4 in this case),
                        a number that can be
                        used to find this particular file in the filesystem
                    </li>
                    <li>Next we read the content of the file by given file
                        descriptor
                    </li>
                    <li>Lastly we release file descriptor back to OS, because
                        amount of file descriptors is limited, you must give
                        them back once you are done working with a file(or
                        socket, that's basically why we have
                        <code>try/finally</code> block in java, to efficiently
                        release file descriptors or other resources we don't
                        need anymore)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The main syscall here is <code>read</code> that accepts 3
                    parameters</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>fd - file descriptor</li>
                    <li>buf - byte array where the content will be saved</li>
                    <li>count - amount of bytes we want to read</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Reading manual page for <code>read</code> call , I didn't
                    find any references to blocking an underlying user Thread,
                    so
                    I start googling and found this article from <a
                    href="https://lwn.net/Articles/612483/">LWN.net</a>. The
                    quote from this blog states
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    So a call to read() on a normal file descriptor can always
                    block; most of the time this blocking causes no
                    difficulties, but it can be problematic for programs that
                    need to always be responsive
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Now we know the problem, <code>InputStream</code> is using
                    blocking system call to read the data by file descriptor.
                    How is it relevant to our backend service ? Well, when you
                    make a networking call to the database or to another
                    service, Linux will use <code>socket</code> syscall that
                    creates a file descriptor for the socket, the
                    <code>read</code> method then will read data from the
                    incoming traffic by using this file descriptor in the same
                    blocking manner. I think you got an idea, to make
                    non-blocking reads we need to use another syscall
                </p>
                <h2>Meet epoll</h2>
                <p>I already talked about <code>epoll</code> in my previous blog
                    where I compared <a
                        href="https://strogiyotec.github.io/pages/posts/io.html">Java
                        with Node js</a> but I didn't show how it can be used
                    within the Java code. Let's see an example by writing a
                    small program that downloads a video from youtube in
                    non-blocking way using <a
                        href="https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client">async-http-client</a>.
                    Here is the code
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">

<span class="o">                final byte[] responseBody = response.getResponseBodyAsBytes();</span>
<span

<span class="o">          .join();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>In essence, we are making a http call that returns a <code>CompletableFuture</code>(java's
                    way to define a Promise), then we block main thread by
                    calling <code>join</code>. Let's see what strace can tell us
                    about this code(you can find and compile this code sample <a
                        href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/strogiyotec.github.io/tree/master/code_samples/loom/loom.test">here</a>.
                    Here is the sample output.

</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>A lot of new syscalls , let's walk through each of them</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>epoll_create1</code> - creates an instance of
                        epoll, in this case kernel create an epoll with id 20
                    </li>
                    <li><code>eventfd2</code> - creates a file descriptor for
                        event notification, in this case the fd is 23
                    </li>
                    <li><code>epoll_ctl</code> - tell the kernel file
                        descriptors you’re interested in updates about, we are
                        interested in fd 23
                    </li>
                    <li><code>epoll_wait</code> - wait for updates about the
                        list of file descriptors you’re interested in
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just a reminder, Linux kernel is written in C so the C
                    equivalent of this program would look like this </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">int epollfd = epoll_create1(0);</span>
<span class="o">epoll_ctl(epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, listener_sockfd, &accept_event)</span>
<span class="o">while (1) {</span>
<span class="o">    int number_fd_ready = epoll_wait(epollfd, events, MAXFDS, -1);</span>
<span class="o">    //some logic to work with these file descriptors</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>As you can see, C version has single thread that fetches
                    available file descriptors without blocking an underling
                    thread. Kernel does all heavy work for us. <code>async-http-client</code>
                    made a great job to
                    give you
                    an abstraction over epoll, but still , most developers are
                    not familiar with this programming style, moreover, writing
                    your code in sequential style is a way easier than working
                    with callbacks and <code>Features</code>. Here comes the
                    first problem that project loom tries to solve, allow Java
                    developers to write your code in the old sequential way.</p>
                <h2>Legacy software can't take advantage of Async API</h2>
                <p>Ok, let's say you know how to write efficient code using
                    asynchronous style, and you are willing to start your new
                    startup with something like Project Reactor , great but keep
                    in mind, Java is old and most Java based backends were
                    written in a blocking way. Servlet API that uses thread
                    per-request model, Hibernate that uses JDBC under the hood
                    meanwhile
                    JDBC is using blocking <code>InputStream</code> to read a
                    data from a wire. Wouldn't it be nice if JVM runtime could
                    detect all blocking calls and replace them with async epoll
                    ? This is exactly what Golang did by using goroutines. Here
                    is an example of http request written in Go</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">func main() {</span>
<span
    class="o">    resp, err := http.Get(&quot;https://example.com/&quot;)</span>
<span class="o">    defer resp.Body.Close()</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>It's similar to http request you would do with <code>RestTemplate</code>,
                    the only difference is , <code>RestTemplate</code> uses
                    <code>read</code> syscall while go uses epoll.
                    Go doesn't force you to write your code with async callbacks
                    in mind, the runtime is smart enough to detect(when
                    possible) syscalls that
                    block your thread and replace them with async equivalents.
                </p>
                <h1>Meet Project Loom</h1>
                <p>Project loom is an attempt from Oracle to make JVM runtime
                    smarter by introducing what is called <strong>Virtual
                        Threads</strong>. I personally found this expression a
                    little vague. In reality , with Project Loom, JVM runtime
                    will replace all blocking calls with non-blocking
                    equivalents the same way as Golang does. You don't have to
                    replace your Servlet API with Project Reactor to use async
                    sockets if jvm runtime
                    can
                    do it for you. Here is a small example(the source code is
                    available <a
                        href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/strogiyotec.github.io/blob/5cb634038d88ec450da3f0063752ea5f7d8aa209/code_samples/loom/loom.test/src/main/java/loom/test/LoomTest.java">here</a>)
                    that shows you how
                    Project Loom is going to work.</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                            class="k"></span>
<span class="o">private record URLData(URL url, byte[] response) { }</span>
<span class="o">private URLData getURL(URL url) throws IOException {</span>
<span class="o">    try (final InputStream in = url.openStream()) {</span>
<span class="o">         return new URLData(url, in.readAllBytes());</span>
<span class="o">    }</span>
<span class="o">byte[] retrieveURL(URL url) throws Exception {</span>
<span class="o">    try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {</span>
<span class="o">        final Callable&lt;URLData&gt; callable = () -> getURL(url);</span>
<span class="o">        return executor.submit(callable).get().response;</span>
<span class="o">    }</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Next we need to compile it using Loom build of open-jdk(You
                    can
                    download it from <a
                        href="https://jdk.java.net/loom/">here</a>) with
                    experimental features enabled
                    flag <code>javac --enable-preview --release 19
                        LoomTest.java</code>, finally let's run it in background
                    mode and save thread dumps</p>
                <figure class="highlight">

</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>Some things to notice</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JVM didn't use <code>read</code> method of InputStream
                    </li>
                    <li>JVM replaced an actual socket implementation with an
                        async one from Java-Nio package
                    </li>
                    <li><code>EPoll.wait</code> method was used which just uses
                        <code>epoll_wait</code> syscall
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is what all Project Loom is about, instead of rewriting
                    Java program using a new programming paradigm, developers
                    could just use virtual threads and JVM runtime will replace
                    all blocking calls with non-blocking ones. There are also
                    some changes in JDK standard library code, for example, all
                    children of Input/Output streams were rewritten to
                    eliminate <code>synchronized</code> keyword because it
                    generates an assembly which doesn't allow kernel to use
                    epoll(I am not sure why, haven't worked with assembly yet).
                </p>
                <h1>Finale</h1>
                <p>I hope it was an interesting read for you, and now you have a
                    better understanding of what virtual threads are
                    actually meant to be and how it works internally in syscalls
                    levels. Cheers !</p>
