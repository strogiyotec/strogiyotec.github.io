                <p>My DBMS of choice is Postgres. I have been using it for the
                    last three years and every time I discover some internal
                    parts which are quite amazing and unique foe Postgres(jsonb
                    index support,materialized views,prepared transactions you
                    name it ).
                    This blog post is some sort of a cheetsheet on How Postgres
                    works internally
                    Without going too deep into implementation details. If you
                    wanna go deeper then
                    search for highlighted keywords in the official <a
                        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/">Postgres
                        documentation</a>
                    . Everything I will cover here is related
                    to <strong>Postgres 12</strong>. Also I am not a Postgres
                    developer and everything I will describe here is based on
                    my understanding gained from Blog posts and
                    documentation. I can
                    easily make mistakes so don't hesitate to mention it
                    so I can improve this post. Okay , Let's start.

                <h1>Where is my data Dude ?</h1>
                <p>Let's start with data. Where Postgres stores databases
                    and
                    tables? If you doesn't set an environmental variable
                    <code>$PGDATA</code> then your Database Cluster is stored in
                    <code>/var/lib/postgresql/12/main</code>. Cluster is a
                    collection of databases managed by Postgres(cluster in the
                    context of Postges is not a cluster of separate servers)
                    . Single database is a collection of database
                    objects(tables,indexes,views...). It's stored under the
                    <mark>base</mark>
                    directory
                    If you go inside of the base directory you will see a list
                    of
                    numbered sub folders. Those
                    are database object ids(
                    <mark><a
                        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-oid.html">OIDS</a>
                    </mark>
                    ).
                    Every folder here represents a database. Let's say I have a
                    database called
                    <mark>test</mark>
                    . If I run this query using
                    <mark>psql</mark>
                    , I can get an
                    associated OID of this database.
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        SELECT datname, oid FROM pg_database WHERE datname =
                        'test';
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    In my case this number was
                    <mark>16384</mark>
                    . Check if
                    you have a folder with this number inside the
                    <mark>base</mark>
                    directory(in your case this number
                    will be different). Now let's
                    <mark>cd</mark>
                    into folder with this number and you will see a bunch of
                    files. Some of them have suffixes <code>_fsm,_vm</code>. We
                    will talk about those files later. Other files(without
                    suffixes) are labeled using numbers. Every file without a
                    suffix is
                    a separate table. Let's check it.
                    In my
                    <mark>test</mark>
                    database I have a table called
                    <mark>users</mark>
                    . Let's see which file is associated with this table.
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        \connect test;
                        <br>
                        SELECT relfilenode FROM pg_class WHERE
                        relname = 'users';
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    In my case it's
                    <mark>17178</mark>
                    . So the file with this number is my
                    <mark>users</mark>
                    table. The data in this file is stored as a list of 8Kb long
                    pages. Every page contains 3 main parts
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>List of tuples - actual data in table rows .</li>
                    <li>Line pointers - each pointer contains a file offset to
                        the start of the tuples.
                    </li>
                    <li>Headers - General information about the page to be used
                        by WAL. Also it contains ID of transaction that created
                        or deleted this tuple(it's used by MVCC)
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    For me it was confusing, what if a table stores a huge BLOB
                    of data in the row ,how would it fit into 8 Kb Page. The
                    answer is
                    <mark>TOAST</mark>
                    . When value is big enough and data type has a variable
                    length(such as a length of a string)
                    then the actual column is stored out of the tuple, and tuple
                    has a pointer to this value. I really recommend you to read
                    this presentation about TOAST
                    <a href="https://pgconf.ru/media/2016/05/13/tuple-internals.pdf">HERE</a>.

                <h1>Multiversion concurrency control</h1>
                <p>Now Let's talk about how different transactions read these
                    <mark>pages</mark>
                    concurrently.
                    <br>Firstly , there are could be multiple versions
                    of the same row at the same point of time. How could we
                    distinguish
                    these versions from each other ? Every row has two hidden
                    fields which indicate a creation time(xmin) and deletion
                    time(xmax). When row is created it's xmin is set to
                    transaction id of the transaction that performed the INSERT,
                    when row is deleted it's xmax is set to transaction ID that
                    performed DELETE or UPDATE. Yes, technically when
                    transaction performs UPDATE then row's xmax is set to
                    transaction ID and new row is created whose xmin is set to
                    transaction ID. Transaction ID? Every database transaction
                    has a unique
                    identifier which is just a 32 byte integer which is
                    incremented every time a new transaction is created.
                    <br>
                    Secondly,every transaction has a state such as
                    committed,aborted,or in progress. These states are stored in
                    <mark>PGDATA/pg_xact</mark>
                    file. Two bites are allocated for every transaction -
                    committed or aborted.
                    <br>
                    Finally let's talk about visibility. When transaction tries
                    to read a row it has to check the following conditions.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read xmin of the row and check from pg_xact file if
                        transaction with this xmin id was completed
                    </li>
                    <li>If transaction was completed was it committed if yes
                        then this row is visible(technically it also depends on
                        isolation level ,as an example repeatable read won't see
                        a row with committed xmin if xmin is bigger than current
                        transaction's ID,while read committed will )
                    </li>
                    <li>If transaction with row's xmin is aborted then this row
                        is not visible
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>So we have multiple versions of the same row and at some
                    point of time some of those versions won't be valid, however
                    they still allocate a physical space . In oder to clean up
                    this space, the process called
                    <mark>VACUUM</mark>
                    is used.
                </p>
                <h1>VACUUM</h1>
                <p>
                    So what Vacuum does? It vacuums away dead tuples and
                    references from indexes to these tuples. Vacuum doesn't
                    clean up the physical space. Instead , it stores dead tuple
                    locations in Free Space Map or FSM(remember I told you about
                    files with suffixes, the ones with _fsm suffix is Free Space
                    Map). When new tuple is gonna be inserted it will override
                    the
                    physical space occupied by dead tuple using FSM(let's say
                    you have dead tuples in the end of the table file, in this
                    case these space will be cleaned and returned to Operating
                    system check out this research to understand how it works <a
                    href="https://postgreshelp.com/postgresql-vacuum-conflicts/">HERE</a>).
                    However ,
                    scanning whole table is expensive that is why another data
                    structure is used to speed up this process called Visibility
                    Map or VM (remember files with _vm suffix). Visibility map
                    works in the same way as pg_xact.
                    It stores boolean bite for every page in the table. This
                    bite indicate if this page has dead tuples. If it doesn't
                    then Vacuum skips this page. Also Vacuum cleans references
                    to dead tuples from indexes. However, and this is important,
                    it doesn't clean up index space. So if you have a table with
                    a lot of deletes or updates, it's better to recreate indexes
                    cause
                    index still occupies physical space with a references to
                    dead
                    tuples even though they won't be used during the index scan.
                    Lastly , Vacuum does one really important thing called
                    freezing. In order to understand what it means we have to
                    return to transaction ID.
                    As I said transaction ID is 32 byte number, what's gonna
                    happen when there is now available number in this range for
                    new transaction(2^32 is reached) ? In this case transaction
                    wrap around will happen and ID counter will start from zero
                    again. It's a little bit confusing because new transaction
                    with ID 1 will think that transaction with id 2^32 is in the
                    future. It will break visibility rules and in order to avoid
                    it Vacuum does a freezing. Vacuum finds pretty old tuples
                    which are visible to all transactions and mark them as
                    frizzed which means it doesn't meter which xmax this row has
                    , it will be visible to all transactions. Freezing is the
                    main reason why long transactions is a bad idea. Before
                    freezing old transactions Vacuum has to make sure there is
                    no
                    transaction that work with these pages. If you open a
                    transaction
                    and forgot to finish it, Vacuum will wait forever so don't
                    forget to set up transaction max age time in your pg_conf
                    file(by default transactions don't have a time out limit)
                </p>
                <h1>WAL or Durability</h1>
                <p>And the last thing I want to mention is WAL or Write Ahead
                    Log. First of all working with disk directly is really
                    expensive it terms of time. RAM and CPU caches are much
                    faster , that is why , When you execute queries the values
                    are read or written to data structure called Buffers which
                    are stored in RAM. Every insert is firstly stored in this
                    buffers and following updated will change Buffer's value.
                    However in order to survive server crashes , Postgres can't
                    blindly
                    store everything in RAM. Therefore, along with data changes
                    ,the log with these changes is maintained. When we update
                    the value in Buffer Cache we also insert a new record to
                    this log. This log is append only so it's much faster than
                    Random disk write. In case of failure , Postgres can
                    replay WAL in order to store consistent data in the disk.
                    WAL is stored on disk as files in the $PGDATA/pg_wal
                    directory , each file is 16Mb and if it's full a new file
                    will be created.
                    Don't worry , commits are also WAL logged so aborted
                    transaction won't be replayed.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Recovery</h3>
                <p>During recovery , the process called postmaster will read all
                    rows from WAL files and execute them one by one . However ,
                    let's say we have 10 WAL files each 16 Mb long, the
                    recovering process will be really long so we need a way to
                    speed up recovery and this way is called CHECKPOINTS
                    <br>
                    During Checkpoints, Postgres should flush the data from
                    buffers to disk . When all dirty buffers(dirty means buffers
                    that store inserts and updates) are flushed to disk the
                    checkpoint is considered to be completed. In this case when
                    postmaster does a recovery , it skips all WAL rows
                    created prior to Checkpoint.
                    The WAL mechanism is really powerful and it's also used
                    during Postgres Replication. Let's say you have a long
                    analytical queries that take hours to complete. These
                    transactions will reduce the speed of other small
                    transactions. In order to avoid it , the easiest way is just
                    run small transactions against main Postgres
                    instance(master), and setup another postgres
                    instance(slave), then stream WAL changes from master to
                    slave so slave will have an up to date information and can
                    be used in order to performer heavyweight analytical
                    queries.

                <h1>Processes</h1>
                <p>Now when we know a little bit about processes let's see how
                    it looks in reality</p>
                <img src="../../images/postgres_stats.png" alt="Stats">
                <p>There are 6 processes that run along with main Postgres
                    process </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>checkpointer - periodically runs checkpoints to save
                        changes from dirty pages to disk
                    </li>
                    <li>background writer - I didn't cover it because it works
                        in the same way as checkpointer, flushes dirty pages to
                        disk ,check documentations to understand why Postgres
                        uses two processes to do it
                    </li>
                    <li>walwriter - writes data to append only log files</li>
                    <li>autovacuum - periodically runs vacuum process</li>
                    <li>statscollector - collect performance and usage
                        statistics such as IO performance and usage of every
                        table in database
                    </li>
                    <li>logical replication launcher - the process that pushes
                        logical changes from master to listeners,I didn't cover
                        it because replication topic is big enough for a
                        separate blog
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>Postgres is a wonderful database which has a huge variety of
                    use cases. It can be used as a NoSQL database with an
                    excellent jsonb support. Also you can use it as a
                    TimeSeries(checkout <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimeScaleDb</a>)
                    database. Spend some time and checkout Postgres
                    Documentation because it's a great example how documentation
                    should be written, I have never seen such a great
                    explanation of complex internals as in Postgres
                    Documentation. I wanna thank <a

                    for his excellent blog series about Postgres in Habr(also
                    he answered some of my questions related to Transaction
                    Isolation so I'm really grateful he spent time 
                    explaining those concepts). Also I highly recommend you to
                    take a look at this blog series about <a

                    by Hironobu SUZUKI that helped me a lot to understand
                    internal data structures used be Postgres. <br>Thanks for
                    your
