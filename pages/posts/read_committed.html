                    Read committed. Default Isolation level for postgres based transactions. As Isolation level it
                    prevents
                    transactions to see uncommitted changes of other transactions(transaction still sees own uncommitted
                    changes).
                    If you are not familiar with this isolation level I highly encourage you to take a look at the <a
                        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/transaction-iso.html">Official documentation</a>.
                    However, some sentences from documentation were unclear fo me so I assume that I could clarify them
                    for those who are as bad in Database theory as I am.

                <h1 id="reevaluated">Re-evaluated</h1>
                <p>The most confusing sentence for me was the one that describes re-evaluation of <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clause namely:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    The search condition of the command (the WHERE clause) is re-evaluated to see if the updated version
                    of the row still matches the search condition.
                    If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation using the updated version of the row.
                    In the case of SELECT FOR UPDATE and SELECT FOR SHARE,
                    this means it is the updated version of the row that is locked and returned to the client.
                </blockquote>
                <p> I want to emphasize that the quote above works only for <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT FOR UPDATE, and SELECT FOR
                    SHARE</code> which means that it doesn't work for plain selects.
                    <br>
                    Let's see how it works with our best friends Alice and Bob and the best designed table called
                    account
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">CREATE TABLE account(id int primary key,name
                        text,amount int);</code>
                </p>
                <p>Now let's insert two values into the table <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">insert
                    INTO account(id,name,amount) VALUES (1,'Bob',200),(2,'Bob',800)</code>.
                    Now open two parallel transactions using <a
                            href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a>
                    (BTW, do you know about <a href="https://www.pgcli.com/">pgcli</a>? I use it daily instead of
                    heavyweight pgAdmin).
                    The first transaction will execute (and not commit) the following query
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">
                        test> update account set amount = 300 where amount = 200; --1
                    </code>.And the second one will execute this query
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">update account set amount = 400 where amount =
                        200;--2</code>.
                    So as the second transaction wants to update a row which has been already updated and hasn't been
                    committed yet
                    it will be locked. The question is , will it update amount to 400 when the first transaction will
                    commit it's changes.
                    Let's see , commit first transaction and see if the second transaction will update amount from 300
                    to
                    400.
                    <br>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">
                        test> select amount from account order by name desc
                        <br>
                        800
                        <br>
                        300
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    So far so good, Postgres follows the documented behavior. The second transaction re-evaluated WHERE
                    clause and as the first transaction committed changes
                    then the second one didn't update any row cause the amount was changed from 200 to 300 and search
                    condition in the second transaction skipped this row.
                </p>
                <h1>What about Subqueries?</h1>
                <p>And here is the most interesting part. Let's return to our previous statement when Bob had two
                    accounts with 800 and 200 respectively.Open two parallel transactions.First one will execute the
                    following query (remember transaction didn't commit this update)
                    <br>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">
                        UPDATE account set amount = 100 where amount = 200; -- 1
                    </code>.
                    And after that the second transaction will execute this query.
                    <br>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">
                        UPDATE account set amount = amount+50 --2
                        <br>
                        where name in
                        <br>
                        (select DISTINCT name from account group by
                        <br>
                        name having sum(amount)>=1000); -- 2
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    So the second transaction wants to add 50 to all accounts whose total amount is bigger or equals to
                    1000. As it wants to update the same row as the first transaction it will be locked.
                    Bob's total amount is 1000. However the first transaction changed amount of the first account from
                    200 to 100
                    so now Bob should have 900 as soon as the first transaction will be committed. Will the second
                    transaction re-evaluate subquery
                    and skip Bob's account? Let's see. Commit first transaction and then the second one.
                    Execute select and account table will look like this.
                    <br>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlight-rouge">
                        SELECT * from account
                        <br>
                        -[ RECORD 1 ]
                        <br>
                        id | 1
                        <br>
                        name | Bob
                        <br>
                        amount | 850
                        <br>
                        -[ RECORD 2 ]
                        <br>
                        id | 2
                        <br>
                        name | Bob
                        <br>
                        amount | 150
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    Which means that the second transaction didn't re-evaluate subquery and updated Bob's accounts even
                    if their total was 900 before changes from the second transaction.
                </p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>For me it was unobvious that <code>READ COMMITTED</code> doesn't re-evaluate subqueries inside <code>WHERE</code>
                    clause but this is how it works. Here is my
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61781595/postgres-read-commited-doesnt-re-read-updated-row?noredirect=1#comment109279507_61781595">
                        StackOverflow
                    </a> question related to it. And lastly , how to fix it? Well the easiest way would by to execute
                    two transactions in <code>REPEATABLE READ</code> isolation level.
                    In this case the second transaction will fail with <code>could not serialize access due to
                        concurrent update</code> exception and your application code
                    will have to add retry logic for this transaction.
