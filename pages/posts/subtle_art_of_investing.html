            <article class="post-content">
                <p>With this blog I want to start a series of posts that will
                    cover the
                    importance of the stock market in one's financial future.
                    The stock market became a
                    hobby of
                    mine 2 years ago(at the time of writing the year is
                    2023). Firstly, I was really sceptical about the topic
                    having
                    a brief picture in mind of people calling me and trying to
                    sell me stocks same way as a scammer is trying to get my
                    credit card information. But after doing some due
                    diligence I actually found out how much did I lose by
                    not starting earlier. This first part will give you some
                    introduction on what stock market
                    is and why you should care.</p>

                <h1 id="alternatives"></h1>
                <p>When I start learning something new it really helps me to
                    understand a problem I am trying to solve. The problem in
                    this case is an
                    excessive cash you might have that looses value overtime and
                    the solution is a stock market. According to <a
                        href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/saving-and-budgeting/articles/how-much-should-i-save">USNews</a>
                    50% of your earnings should go to necessities, 30% to
                    discretionary items and 20% to savings. Fair enough let's do
                    some math. If you earn 10,000 Canadian dollars per
                    month after tax(which is considered a high income here in
                    a beautiful Vancouver B.C ) then at least 20% of the salary
                    must go into savings which is 2,000 dollars.
                    Great, what do we do now. Let's say you just keep the money
                    in your checking account which has many advantages the main
                    one being the liquidity. This liquid cash can help you in
                    case
                    of an emergency(which is a question of when
                    rather than if) or in case if you decide to make a huge
                    purchase(home or car).
                    <br>
                    What are the disadvantages then ? There are many but the
                    main
                    one is losing the purchasing power. <i>Dollar today is
                        worth more than tomorrow</i>. That's because the prices
                    for goods are always going up. The rise in prices is also
                    called as Inflation. According to <a
                        href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/">Bank
                        of Canada</a> the average inflation rate for Canadian
                    Dollar since 1914 is 3.06% per year meaning the cash you
                    hold will lose around 3% of it's buying power each year. So
                    now having cash doesn't sound attractive at all.
                    <br>
                    What do we
                    do next ? Well in my case prior to entering the Stock Market
                    I used to hold all the cache in the bank's saving account.
                    The way banks make money(at least how I understand it,
                    reading
                    financials of the banks gives my a headache so please
                    forgive me if my conception is wrong) is by taking a cash
                    from customer accounts and giving this cash to customers who
                    want to get
                    a mortgage or any other credit lines and then will repay
                    this credit with some interest on top. Banks can share this
                    profit from interests with you if you hold your money in the
                    saving
                    account. But what is a rate you can earn from
                    your bank ? As of time of writing <a
                        href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/bank-accounts/account-rates">Toronto
                        Dominion bank
                    </a>gives around 1.850% if you open TD ePremium Saving
                    account. Other big 6 Canadian banks(RBC,BMO etc.) have the
                    same or even
                    lower rates. Pretty low I would say, but it's not
                    over, in Canada we have
                    many branchless banks that only operate online and save
                    money on renting office properties. One of these banks is my
                    favorite <a
                        href="https://www.eqbank.ca/personal-banking/savings-plus-account?nis=8">EQ
                        Bank</a>. As of time of writing EQB give you 2.5% plus
                    0.5% as bonus interest making 3% in total. As a reminder we
                    should earn more than 3.06% to keep up with inflation. Still
                    not good enough. Another alternative is <a
                        href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca">WealthSimple</a>
                    which gives you 4% on your first 100,000 dollars and then
                    4.5%. I personally didn't find anything higher than what
                    WealthSimple can offer. Now we have a solution, we can store
                    our money in the bank or in the financial institution and
                    grow money in a rate higher than an inflation.
                </p>
                <h1 id="gic">GIC</h1>
                <p>
                    Another alternative to saving account is a GIC.
                    GIC or <strong>Guaranteed investment certificates</strong>
                    is a deposit investment sold by Canadian banks.
                    When you buy a GIC, you are basically lending the bank money
                    and getting paid interest in return for the favor. The
                    difference from saving account is that you can't withdraw
                    your money for a specific period of time(3 month, 1 year
                    etc.).
                    Because of the high interest rate environment, current rates
                    are pretty attractive. For example right now you can get
                    5.75% if you buy 1 year GIC from EQB.
                    So main advantage of GIC is a higher rate and security. In
                    Canada your GIC founds are CDIC insured for up to 100k
                    meaning even if your bank goes bankrupt, you will be repaid.
                    <br>
                    The main disadvantage I can think of is the ability of GIC
                    to pay high interests. As an example, on March 2022 when
                    interest rates were low the 1 year GIC only paid 1.75% in
                    interests.
                </p>
                <h1 id="bonds">Bonds</h1>
                <p>Nevertheless, I would prefer my hardly-earned money to give
                    me a higher rate, so I can grow my wealth faster than
                    inflation and then have a bigger buying power once I am
                    retired. Unfortunately, as we have just seen, the interest
                    rates from saving accounts and GIC are hardly keep up with
                    inflation.
                    <br>
                    The next way to earn a high interest rate is Bonds.
                    Bonds represent a loan from the buyer (you) to the issuer of
                    the bond. If it sounds complicated don't worry we will go
                    over it. Basically when a company needs money it has several
                    options to raise the capital. The most commons are
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Borrowing money from a bank(taking a debt)</li>
                    <li>Issue stocks(we will discuss it right after bonds)</li>
                    <li>Issue bonds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So what is a bond ?
                    Think about it as a document, physical or digital, you give
                    money to the company . Company in turn
                    gives you a promise that after a specified period of
                    time(<b> maturity
                    period</b>) company will pay you back and give you some
                    interest
                    on top. Basically similar to the saving account, but you
                    can't withdraw the money until the Bond's maturity. Why
                    would a company prefer bonds over the debt from a bank?
                    There are several reasons such as a variable rate. For
                    example right now Canada has the highest rates in the last
                    20 years.
                    It means that banks would have to increase their rates for
                    the existing borrowers. Let's say a company took a debt few
                    years ago when interest rates were close to 0 and now
                    company have to pay around 6% . By issuing bonds
                    company can decide by itself the
                    interest which won't be effected by the economic situation
                    in the country.
                    The next reason is the conditions from the bank. If a
                    company went bankrupt then it would not be able to repay the
                    debt so the bank must ensure that company would have enough
                    assets to repay the debt. By the way, company that went
                    bankrupt might also not be able to repay the bonds so there
                    is some risk involved in owning bonds comparing with GIC or
                    saving accounts.
                    Now when we have a broad idea on what bond are let's check
                    what
                    we can actually earn from them. Unlike the saving account,
                    it's somewhat more complicated to buy a bond, you can do it
                    from
                    companies website directly(For example go to MacDonald's
                    website and find a bonds section) or through the brokerage(I
                    will explain what the brokerage is later when we will cover
                    the stocks).
                    One of the broker that I use , namely Questrade, offers
                    bonds

                </p>
                <p>As you can see the Province of Manitoba offers bonds with
                    10.5%
                    coupon rate , yield of 4.325% and maturity date of
                    3/4/2031. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coupon rate - the annual interest rate that bond will
                        pay
                    </li>
                    <li>Yield - the annual interest rate that you will earn
                        holding the bond
                    </li>
                    <li>A bond's term to maturity is the length of time during
                        which the owner will receive interest payments on the
                        investment. When the bond reaches maturity your original
                        payment
                        is repaid.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>One question you might have is why coupon rate is different
                    from the yield. The reason is that those bonds are already
                    sold to other people and are circulated in the market. Let's
                    say Alice
                    bought
                    this bond from Manitoba worth of 1,000 dollars. Now
                    instead of just holding the bond till the maturity Alice
                    might decide to
                    sell it to someone else. It doesn't make sense for her to
                    sell the
                    bond for the same 1,000 because she can simply hold it and
                    earn 10%(100$) after the first year, so instead she can go
                    to open
                    market and sell this bond for 1,060 to Bob. Now after the
                    first year Bob will earn 100$ in interest but because he
                    paid 1060$ his actual yield is 4.325%
                </p>
                <p>With bonds you might find a more attractive yields on your
                    money. Typically , companies with a bad ratings have to give
                    a higher coupon rate because there is bankruptcy risk
                    involved
                    .
                    Would you rather own a bond from Apple with yield of 4% or
                    bond from a new mining company with yield 10% ?</p>
                <p>
                    Another thing to mention is an inverse relation between
                    interest rates and bonds.
                    Let's say the interest rate is 2% and Alice can buy a bond
                    with a 4% yield, after a year interest rates went up and
                    newly issued bonds would offer 10%.
                    If Alice decides to sell her bond to Bob will he rather buy
                    a 4% yield bond from her or just buy a new one with a higher
                    yield ? I think the answer is obvious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The yields from bonds are almost identical to inflation
                    rate.
                    I personally don't invest in bonds because I keep all
                    emergency founds in either savings or short term GICs(3
                    month).
