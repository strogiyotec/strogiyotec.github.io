                <p>I heard about <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">graalvm</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/">native-images</a>
                    for a while but have never used them. At the same time I do use a lot of CLI apps written in Golang
                    but none of them is written in Java so why not to try to write one and use a native-image to pack it
                    . Here I want to share some lessons that I learnt from it.

                <h1 id="jfill">Jfill?</h1>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin">Jfill</a> is a
                    command line utility that allows you to use the same command with different set of arguments.
                    Let's say you want to connect to postgres using psql but you have two servers (local and stage)
                    with different user names and ports.Will you make two different aliases for it ?
                    <code>alias psql_stage='psql -U admin -H stage'</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>alias psql_local='psql -U postgres -H localhost'</code>
                    <br>
                    This is where you can use jfill. Jfill has the following syntax
                    <code>jfill psql -u {{psql:user}} -p {{psql:port}}</code>.
                    Here, psql is the tag, when you execute this command you will be promoted to the menu
                    to fill port and user , after doing it two times (first time for local environment and second time
                    for stage)
                    you will be able to execute this command and have auto completion for both environments using TAB.
                    For more examples check the <a href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin">README</a> (it also
                    contains gif screencast).

                <h2 id="cli">CLI and Java</h2>
                <p>I have been searching for proper java library to build cli apps for ages(hours).
                </p>
                <ul> The main requirements I had :
                    <li>Documentation. The library has to have a proper documentation</li>
                    <li>Autocompletion. As I said you can trigger autocompletion with TAB that is why I was looking for
                        library that supports it(You can't use plain Scanner for it)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I found only one library called <a href="https://github.com/jline/jline3">Jline3</a>.
                    The main disadvantage is documentation. The code is not documented(at least the classes that I
                    used)
                    and wiki page doesn't contain all examples(with a lot of TODO comments). I was really disappointed
                    because Golang is quite a new language(comparing with Java), however it has a lot of open source
                    libraries that help you to
                    build cli
                    apps (Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">lazygit</a> and <a
                            href="https://github.com/bcicen/ctop">ctop</a> , both apps are used by me and I highly
                    recommend you to check them out).
                </p>
                <h2 id="graalvm">Graalvm and native-image</h2>
                <p>
                    Native-image utility allows you to package your java app into
                    an executable. You can share this executable or deploy it in server even without a JVM.
                    How? JVM and all runtime for Java will be packed into an executable. It works well but I found two
                    problems.
                    <br>
                    Firstly, the size of an executable. The final size of jfill is 16MB(Just for
                    comparison,lazygit with all reach functionality takes 13 MB and ctop takes 9 MB) which is not
                    acceptable for small cli apps.
                    Moreover, I do use Java 11 which means that a lot of libraries were removed according to OSGI
                    model(libraries such as Javafx and javax)
                    . This is a known issue with existing github <a
                        href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/287">ticket</a> .
                    They only solution that I found was <a
                        href="https://github.com/upx/upx">UPX</a> which is CLI utility that compresses size of
                    executables (it decreased size of jfill from 16 to 4MB) .
                    <br>
                    Secondly, native-image doesn't work if you use Reflection API
                    (at least it doesn't work without proper configuration). I don't use it but the Jline3(the library
                    used by jfill) does.
                    In order to fix it ,you have to create json file in your resources folder and declare all Reflection
                    calls .Fortunately ,
                    native-image has a nice feature to execute jar file with Java agent
                    that will collect information about Reflection calls and save them into the json file .Using
                    statistics
                    from
                    json you can build an executable. You can find how it's implemented in jfill.
                    (In order to collect statistics, use this command<br>
                    <code>java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=META-INF/native-image -jar your_jar</code>
                    more info in graal documentation).For other native-image limitations check out this <a
                        href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md">page</a>.
                </p>
                <h2 id="testable-code">Don't forget about tests</h2>
                <p>In this section I want to describe some best practises that I use in order to make my code
                    testable.<br>
                    A lot of people say that tests are the most important part of the development. Moreover, some
                    developers use the special development method called TDD where you write tests first and only then
                    you write an actual logic. I personally don't like this approach because during development
                    you could change public API of your classes thousand times and consequently tests signatures.
                    Additionally, writing tests is the development time. I don't think that people behind startups are
                    interested in
                    100% test coverage when they are not sure if product will be popular.
                    Long story short, having tests for your software is definitely good idea but not obligatory.
                    However your code has to be testable. What does it mean ? Let me show you untestable code from jfill
                    and how I changed it to be more test friendly.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3 id="dependency-injection">Dependency injection</h3>
                <p>Let's look at the <a
                        href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin/blob/8441ceccbecd35543d0685092083b1b169ec8514/src/main/java/jfill/ShellCommand.java#L34-L38">ShellCommand</a>
                    class from jfill.
                    This class executes shell command in the terminal. I want you to pay attention to these
                    lines
                </p>

                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k"> var process = new ProcessBuilder()</span>
<span class="o">    .command(resolvedArgs)</span>
<span class="o">    .inheritIO()</span>
<span class="o">    .start();</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>As you can see I create ProcessBuilder in order to execute shell command and redirect input and
                    output of the shell command to Java process.In this case the main terminal will print you the
                    output.What is wrong with it? Well, I don't think that this code is testable.What if I want to write
                    a test that verifies the output . The previous implementation of jfill created ProcessBuilder inside a method.
                    How to solve it?
                    Use dependency injection, instead of creating ProcessBuilder inside the method let's accept Builder
                    as a method param. Main class will create builder that inherits IO while test will create a Builder
                    that sends output
                    to temporary file(Remember , Main class is just a main entry to our app with main method, there is
                    no
                    reason to test main, but we should test the components used by main).
                    <br>
                    Now ShellCommand looks like <a
                            href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin/blob/master/src/main/java/jfill/ShellCommand.java">this</a>
                    and this is the <a
                            href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin/blob/master/src/test/java/jfill/ShellCommandTestCase.java">test</a>
                    for it.(Output is redirected to temporary file and then I test if file's content is equal to given
                    string)
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k"> new ShellCommand(</span>
<span class="o">    new String[]{"echo", "{{msg1}}", "{{msg2}}"},</span>
<span class="o">    new ValuesStorage(...),</span>
<span class="o">    new ProcessBuilder().redirectOutput(cacheFile)</span>
<span class="o">).execute();</span>
<span class="o">assertEquals(</span>
<span class="o"> "Hello World",</span>
<span class="o"> Files.readString(cacheFile.toPath());</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <h3 id="statics">Static modifier</h3>
                <p>There are a lot articles about static modifier and why it shouldn't exist in OOP world.
                    Let's look at the Execution class from jfill that executes ShellCommand and
                    saves parameters into the json file(In order to use them for auto completion).
                    Jfill has a feature that is common to all CLI apps.It can print version and help information.Let's
                    have look at the <a
                            href="https://github.com/strogiyotec/jfillin/blob/8441ceccbecd35543d0685092083b1b169ec8514/src/main/java/jfill/Execution.java#L77-L79">method</a>
                    that prints version
                </p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k">private void printVersion() {</span>
<span class="o">    System.out.println("jfillin 1.0");</span>
<span class="o"> }</span>
</code></pre>

                <p>It uses static attribute System.out which is an instance of PrintStream that prints input to the
                    console.And here is the problem. How to test that it really prints something. We are not able to
                    check
                    System.out instance unless we mock it which will bring powermock dependency to our code(Library that
                    allows you to mock static methods and attributes).I personally don't like powermock because it makes
                    our tests slower.How to solve it? Again let's use dependency
                    injection, Execution class will accept instance of PrintStream as a method attribute and Main
                    class will pass System.out instance to the method while tests will use nice class called
                    ByteArrayOutputStream that saves all output in the byte array. We could verify that the content of
                    byte array contains version information</p>

                <h1>Hide complex generics</h1>
                <p>Let's say I have a tag <code>psql</code> that stores variables for stage and local postgres.This is
                    how it looks like in history file(jfill stores all your commands in json file in order to  you auto completion):</p>
                <figure class="highlight">
                        <pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span
                                class="k">{</span>
<span class="o">"psql":[</span>
<span class="o">    {</span>
<span class="o">    "port":"5432","user":"postgres","host":"localhost"</span>
<span class="o">    },</span>
<span class="o">    {</span>
<span class="o">    "port":"5432","user":"admin","host":"stage"</span>
<span class="o">    }</span>
<span class="o"> ]</span>
</code></pre>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    In order to work with this tag I used to have a Map where key was a tag name and value was another
                    Map with key value pairs that represents the name of attribute and the value
                    <code>Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p>And now If I want to get a host from psql tag I have to use this code
                    <code>map.get("psql").get("host")</code> which is inconvenient(At least for me).
                    <br>
                    That is why I moved this logic into a separate class called <code>ValuesStorage</code>. This class
                    has
                    a nice method called <code>get</code> that accepts name of the tag and name of the parameter.Now the
                    same code
                    could be rewritten using the following syntax
                    <br>
                    <code>valuesStorage.get("psql","host")</code>(The ValuesStorage uses the same Map as was described
                    above, however now the actual implementation is hidden from client and it became easier to work with
                    tag logic).
                </p>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>It was a fun writing a CLI app in Java. However , the Java ecosystem is too far from being a right
                    choice for CLI apps and for now I will stay with Golang.</p>
